## Extensions

### Addon icon packs

`frost-icon` comes with a base icon pack (`frost`) from `ember-frost-core`. 
To include an icon pack for your addon simply add the following to your `package.json`

```json
"ember-frost-icon-pack": {
  "name": "<name>",
  "path": "<custom path>"
}
```

**Name** is required as a namespace for your icons.  **Path** is optional
and defaults to `svgs/` if not provided.  Avoid using the `public/` 
directory as a path since all of the assest in public will be copied
to `dist` and the SVGs will already be present in the icon pack.

Icons from an icon pack can be consumed using the [icon pack](#icon pack) 
component format.

### App (or dummy app) icon packs

Local icon packs can be configured using `ember-cli-build.js` options.

```javascript
var app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
    iconPackOptions: {
      name: '<name>',
      path: '<custom path>'
    }
  });
```

Parameters follow the same format as [addon](#addon icon packs) 
based icon packs. The default path for dummy apps is 
`tests/dummy/svgs`.

## How icon packs work

`ember-frost-core` contains a build process that looks for the 
`ember-frost-icon-pack` configuration in all installed ember addons
and apps.  The SVGs in the configured path are consolidated into a 
sprite sheet and stored in `dist/assets/icon-packs/<name>` using 
the svgstore concept detailed in [CSSTricks](https://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts/).

The `frost-icon` component then loads the icon pack files and 
displays individual icons via SVG `use` (which has been polyfilled 
to work with legacy IE browsers using [svg4everybody](https://github.com/jonathantneal/svg4everybody)).

`use` allows the icon pack files to be cached in the client and retains
the [advantages](https://css-tricks.com/icon-fonts-vs-svg/) of inline 
SVGs versus icon fonts.

## Legacy support

The icon pack feature contains support for the legacy form of 
`frost-icon`, merging svgs from the prior `public/` svg paths 
into the the default `frost` icon-pack.  Deprecation notices will 
be displayed until the svgs are moved from `public/` and flat icon 
packs are used instead of nested directories.

Legacy support will continue until `ember-frost-core` 1.0 is released.

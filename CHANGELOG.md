* **Added** `frost-select-outlet` and documented it.

# 0.28.0

* **Added** [ember-elsewhere](https://github.com/ef4/ember-elsewhere) as a new dependency.
* **Changed** `frost-select` and `frost-multi-select` to render dropdown elsewhere in the DOM, using `ember-elsewhere`, in order to make them more flexible.
* **Changed** minimum Ember version from `2.1` to `2.3` since `ember-elsewhere` doesn't appear to work on versions prior to `2.3`.

<!-- Reviewable:end -->

* **Updated** CHANGELOG.md file to remove Reviewable note.


# 0.22.0

guards added for any consuming app @ ember 2.7

# 0.21.1

* **Fixed** bug in `treeForAddon` that can affect consumers.

# 0.21.0

- **Changed** from `ember-lodash` to `ember-lodash-shim`. This means upgrading from `lodash` version `3.x` to version `4.x` which could impact consumers relying on [things removed](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#v400) in `lodash` version `4.0.0`.

# 0.20.0

- **Added** Consumers can now use 'hook' attr of core components to enable easier testing with addons like ember-cli-page-object

# 0.19.2

Fixed how negative indices are handled by frost-select.

# 0.19.1

* **Fixed** components that use `ember-prop-types` to work as expected in integration tests by explicitly consuming the `ember-prop-types` mixin instead of relying on the initializer which isn't executed in an integration test environment.

# 0.19.0
The select input widgets now use redux.

# 0.18.1

* **Fixed** `frost-textarea`'s `onInput` handler to propagate change immediately to consumer rather than wait for another Ember run loop to pass.

# 0.18.0

## Text/Password native event support
- Mapped all available DOM events to Frost events (e.g. focusIn -> onFocusIn) see the demo for a full list
- Event hooks respond with native DOM events instead of {id, value} object, this is still supported as a legacy usage, but please switch (no way to detect when the legacy attributes are used unfortunately)
- Deprecated `onFocus` (replaced by `onFocusIn`)
- Deprecated `onBlur` (replaced by `onFocusOut`)
- Removed the `excludedEvents` property from the FrostEvents mixin, this is covered automatically when local events are present

## Text/Password visual and behavioral updates
- Added a new color (grey-7) to the palette for input borders
- Updated the visuals and animation for hover, focus, clear and show/hide

## Text/Password demo updates
- Demos demonstrate legacy, native, text support and deprecated events
- Updated the text/password demos to use snippets

## New keycodes util
- Added a keycodes enum for use in matching keycodes from keyboard events

## Code cleanup
- Integrated ember-concurrency for async behavior in text/password (clear text, show/hide password)
- Text/password actions are fully run-loop compliant and clean up automatically on component destruction

## Future
- Moving towards dropping ember-one-way-controls from the dependency list (requires Ember 2.3.1+)

# 0.17.3
 * **Fixes** a bug in `frost-select` where the options popover was closed whenever someone typed into the input (when `selectedValue` is passed in as props).
 * **Updated** `eslint` within the project to `3.x`

 * **Updated** `tests/` directory to no longer specify an `.eslintrc` with `globals` that shouldn't actually be globals.

# 0.11.4

Duplicated the icons in the `frost` icon pack - duplicates now exist in the legacy `frost/<icon>` nested paths and new `<icon>` flat path.  This allows icons from the `frost` icon pack to be migrated off the deprecated nested paths.  The nested duplicates will be removed in release 1.0.

# 0.11.3

* **Added** new `pack` property to `frost-button` which gets passed down to underlying `frost-icon`.

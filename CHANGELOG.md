## WARNING: THIS REVERTS EMBER CLI 2.16.2 BACK TO 2.12.3

We apologize for this change. Unfortunately, due to the internal needs of our organization this became a required action.

The 2.16.2 changes are now located in the `ember-cli-2.16.2` branch and will hopefully be contained in a versioned release again in the future.

# 2.0.2 (2017-10-25)

* **Removed** code setting babel plugins inside `index.js` since it is no longer needed for `ember-decorators'

* **Removed** running of ember-try its-2.12 scenario until issue is resolved: https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try/issues/148
* **Updated** blueprint helper tests to be commented out since in babel 6 CommonJS files are converted to AMD (which needs import of require) and then being transpiled.

# 1.24.0 (2017-10-16)
- Update colors to match Frost Visual Style Guide 1.624 (2017-09-12).  Added colors include named alarm colors, status colors, yellows, and browns.  Some colors were fixed to match the most recent versions.

# 1.23.13 (2017-09-12)

* Use ember-cli-notifications v4.2.1 - 4.2.0 was using a beta version of ember-css-modules


# 1.23.12 (2017-09-11)

# 1.23.10 (2017-08-10)

* **Updated** `ember-cli-build.js` to `includePolyfill: true` for `ember-cli-babel` as part of issue: https://github.com/ciena-frost/ember-frost-core/issues/488

 * fix frost-scroll content size being reduced by calling perfect-scrollbar `update` when renders
   * Fixes BPSO-54864




# 1.22.5 (2017-06-27)
* Added x-axis scroll event handlers to frost-scroll
* Added tests for new scroll events

# 1.22.4 (2017-06-19)

Added style rules for the hover state of the frost-toggle button switch. The switch will now turn a light blue color when the user mouses over the toggle. If the toggle is disabled, the switch will not change color. 

# 1.22.3 (2017-06-05)
* **Removed** unneeded dependencies left over from when blueprints were moved to another repo: https://github.com/ciena-frost/ember-frost-core/pull/457/files

* **Updated** the lgrey colours


# 1.22.0 (2017-05-31)

* **Added** `frost-expand` component and `frost-error` component


# 1.21.3 (2017-05-30)

 * **Moved** `ember-cli-frost-blueprints` from `dependencies` in `package.json` to being installed as a blueprint. It turns out that [`ember-cli` cheats w.r.t. `ember-cli-legacy-blueprints`](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/blob/v2.8.0/lib/models/project.js#L347) and so we can't follow that pattern (of just making it an `npm` dep). 

# 1.21.2 (2017-05-30)

* **Updated** `ember-cli-forst-blueprints` to `1.x`


# 1.21.1 (2017-05-26)
* Set notification z-index to appear above modals


# 1.21.0 (2017-05-26)
* **Removed** blueprints for generating tests, they are now provided by `ember-cli-frost-blueprints`
* **Added** `ember-cli-frost-blueprints` to the `dependencies` so that the same blueprints are still available to consumers of this addon. 
* **Fixed** [#374](https://github.com/ciena-frost/ember-frost-core/issues/374) by doing the above. 

# 1.20.1 (2017-05-17)
* **Updated** `ember` from `bower.json` to `ember-source` from `package.json`
* **Updated** ember-try config matrix for `ember-source`
* **Updated** `ember-cli-shims` to the npm package instead of the bower package
* **Updated** path to the test resolver
* **Updated** path to `ember-template-compiler` needed for `frost-events-tests.js` integration tests
* **Removed** unneeded mocha packages from bower that are now included



# 1.20.0 (2017-05-11)

* **Added** missing export of `windowUtils` inside `utils` that's exported from `addon/index.js`. Consumers can now import the `windowUtils` without needing to know the   path in the filesystem:
  ```js
  import {utils} from 'ember-frost-core'
  const {windowUtils} = utils
  ``` 
  instead of
  ```js
  import windowUtils from 'ember-frost-core/utils/window'
  ```
 * **Added** `frost-link` test helpers to `addon-test-support`, specifically just a `stubRouteService` helper method to allow consumers of `frost-link` to check the routes passed into it. 
* **Cleaned** up the integration tests for `frost-link` a little. 



# 1.19.1 (2017-05-11)

* **Added** onClick callback for frost-select


# 1.19.0 (2017-05-10)

* **Added** `frost-bookends` component, implementing the pattern used by `ember-frost-modal` for a fixed header/footer with scrolling content in between. Complete with the shadow effect on the header/footer when content is scrolled beneath it. One notable difference between the styling of `frost-bookends` and that of `ember-frost-modal` is the lack of transparency in the footer, with content scrolling beneath it. This was intentional, as directed by UX (@baconC)
* **Refactored** tests for `frost-password` to make them a little DRYer, and added a test (currently only in Chrome) for the feature that maintains selected text across reveal toggles. 


# 1.18.0 (2017-05-04)

* **added** ability to pass specific options to frost-scroll


# 1.17.0 (2017-04-27)

* **Upgraded** to `ember-test-utils@4.x`
* **Upgraded** to `ember-cli-code-coverage@0.3.12` (using a pinned `ember-code-snippet@1.7.0` so as to avoid overwriting `require` and breaking `ember-cli-code-coverage`)
* **Enabled** code coverage gating in PRs. 
* **Added** `onToggle` callback which is called with the new value whenever toggled
* **Deprecated** `onClick` callback, which wasn't handling raw functions very well when going through the event proxy
* **Fixed** [#439](https://github.com/ciena-frost/ember-frost-core/issues/439) Properly handle falsy `trueValue`/`falseValue` when `trueLabel`/`falseLabel` are set


# 1.16.0 (2017-04-27)
- Added secondary labels in select #281 



# 1.15.0 (2017-04-25)
- Consume broccoli-autoprefixer


# 1.14.6 (2017-04-21)
- Bumped ember-elsewhere version

# 1.14.5 (2017-04-21)

* **Fixed** a typo that was introducing exponents in an if statement for no good reason.


# 1.14.4 (2017-04-20)

* **Fixed** a typo that was introducing exponents in an if statement for no good reason.


# 1.14.3 (2017-04-11)

* **Fixed** issues with Firefox and updated CI to test against Firefox as well as Chrome.

  example the hook for the select being tested is `mySelect`):

    open,
    selectItemAtIndex
  } from 'dummy/tests/helpers/ember-frost-core/frost-select'

# 0.28.0

* **Added** [ember-elsewhere](https://github.com/ef4/ember-elsewhere) as a new dependency.
* **Changed** `frost-select` and `frost-multi-select` to render dropdown elsewhere in the DOM, using
`ember-elsewhere`, in order to make them more flexible.
* **Changed** minimum Ember version from `2.1` to `2.3` since `ember-elsewhere` doesn't appear to work on versions
prior to `2.3`.

consuming context

# 0.27.3

# 0.21.1

* **Fixed** bug in `treeForAddon` that can affect consumers.

# 0.21.0

- **Changed** from `ember-lodash` to `ember-lodash-shim`. This means upgrading from `lodash` version `3.x` to version
`4.x` which could impact consumers relying on [things removed](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#v400)
in `lodash` version `4.0.0`.

# 0.20.0

- **Added** Consumers can now use 'hook' attr of core components to enable easier testing with addons like
ember-cli-page-object

# 0.19.2

Fixed how negative indices are handled by frost-select.

# 0.19.1

* **Fixed** components that use `ember-prop-types` to work as expected in integration tests by explicitly consuming
the `ember-prop-types` mixin instead of relying on the initializer which isn't executed in an integration test
environment.

# 0.19.0
The select input widgets now use redux.

# 0.18.1

* **Fixed** `frost-textarea`'s `onInput` handler to propagate change immediately to consumer rather than wait for

## Text/Password native event support
- Mapped all available DOM events to Frost events (e.g. focusIn -> onFocusIn) see the demo for a full list
- Event hooks respond with native DOM events instead of {id, value} object, this is still supported as a legacy
usage, but please switch (no way to detect when the legacy attributes are used unfortunately)
- Deprecated `onFocus` (replaced by `onFocusIn`)
- Deprecated `onBlur` (replaced by `onFocusOut`)
- Removed the `excludedEvents` property from the FrostEvents mixin, this is covered automatically when local events
are present

## Text/Password visual and behavioral updates
- Added a new color (grey-7) to the palette for input borders
- Updated the visuals and animation for hover, focus, clear and show/hide

## Text/Password demo updates
- Demos demonstrate legacy, native, text support and deprecated events
- Updated the text/password demos to use snippets

## New keycodes util
- Added a keycodes enum for use in matching keycodes from keyboard events

## Code cleanup
- Integrated ember-concurrency for async behavior in text/password (clear text, show/hide password)
- Text/password actions are fully run-loop compliant and clean up automatically on component destruction

## Future
- Moving towards dropping ember-one-way-controls from the dependency list (requires Ember 2.3.1+)

# 0.17.3
 * **Fixes** a bug in `frost-select` where the options popover was closed whenever someone typed into the input (when
   `selectedValue` is passed in as props).
 * **Updated** `eslint` within the project to `3.x`
 * **Added** some linting rules for `mocha` (via an update to `eslint-config-frost-standard`)
 * **Updated** `tests/` directory to no longer specify an `.eslintrc` with `globals` that shouldn't actually be
 globals.

button demo as an example.

Fixed a broken build when a consuming app doesn't specify an application icon pack and doesn't contain the legacy
`public/svgs` icons path

# 0.11.4

Duplicated the icons in the `frost` icon pack - duplicates now exist in the legacy `frost/<icon>` nested paths and
new `<icon>` flat path.  This allows icons from the `frost` icon pack to be migrated off the deprecated nested
paths. The nested duplicates will be removed in release 1.0.

# 0.11.3
